It's
actually
in
those
improvised
moments
when
you
can
really
clearly
tell
the
creativity
and
light
speed
reactions
of
professional
actor
RDJ
in
this
video
and
BC
in
Mad

especially
Not
that

Robert
was
low

feeling
some
type
of

inspired
by

to
make
Tony

That

Does
anyone
else
think
RDJ
is
SO
FINE
Emotional
Interview
with
Tony
Stark
Is
it
just
me
or
when
they
were
acting
overly
calm
it
sounded
like
presenter
was
high
on
weed
or
something
That's
enough
outta
you
More
people
need
to
just
flat
out
do
this
to
Jimmy
love
how
Youtube
algorythm
works
RDJ
is
classy
when
bought
the
suit
needed
to
watch
this
5
times
to
understand
he
doesn't
mean
the
iron

that

is
priceless
always
loved
how
Jimmy
Fallon
interviews
people
without
getting
too
touchy
about
topics
that
aren
supposed
to
be
discussed
Here
the
story
of
playboy
genius
1

so
wanted
Robert
to
say
Well
what
do
know
Iron
Man
after
that
Jimmy
needs
to
get
the
whole
avengers
cast
on
his
show
Came
here
right
after
Lupita
Nyong
and
refuse
to
believe
that
I'm
the
only
one
without
hobbies
LOL
love
whenever
overly
calm
emotion
popped
up
and
they
both
just
sighed
For
some
reason
thought
of
jungkook
when
Robert
Downey
jr
said
pardon
if
you
mention
his
height
things
will
really
get
emotional
RDJ
can
adaopt
so
quickly
this
is
why
he
is
such
good
actor

just
sounds
high
xD
When
he
said
emotional

the
look
on
rdj's
face
is
mood
Gooshh
He
is
just
perfect
This
is
why
RDJ
makes
great
Tony
Stark
Brilliant
how
Jimmy
glances
second
time
back
to
the
Bacon
prompt
like
Really
That's
enough
out
of
you
makes
me
laugh
so
hard
This
interview
was
exactly
2
years
before
Infinity
War
love
you
3000
The
doesn't
know
what
car
is
part
was
sooooo
well
acted
Jimmy
was
humble
bragging
instead
of
fishing
for
compliments
That's
enough
outta
you
yeah
if
only
lol
Pardon
That
birthday
card
part
at
the
end
He
really
should
just
get
his
name
legally
changed
to
Tony
Stark
You'r
getting
into
Character
as
you
Pretty
much
RDJ
when
he
plays
Tony
Stark
just
love
him
3000
That's
enough
outta
you
And
here
am
thinking
Robert
was
actually
going
to
get
emotional
about
something
Silly
me
One
of
them
should'v
been
Jimmy
doesn't
like
Iron
Man
that
enough
out
of
you
CRYING
need
more
RDJ
and
Jimmy
doing
some
funny
games
love
this
man
so
damn

This
is
some
high

improv
I'm

calm
can't
even

you
right
now
Is

Lol
and
love
how
kept
the
birthday
joke
going
They'r
both
brilliant
The
card
thing
was
smooth
love
RDJ
He's
amazing
When
Tony
died
in
Endgame
it
felt
like
he
died
in
real
life
Anyone
after
Endgame
That
awkward
moment
when
you
came

am
Iron
Man
I'v
watched
this
way
too
many
times
emotional
like
um
when
he
um
kinda
um
died
You
should
remember
this
all
the
time
Life
is
like
clam
total
lack
of
confidence
actually
made
me
so
sad
So
relaxed
cannot
even
hear

lost
it
when
he
said
is
it
sausage
Well

the
most
click
baitey
title
ve
seen
from
you
so
far
It
said
Overly
Calm
not
Stoned
at
first
thought
this
was
going
to
be
Robert
talking
about
his
past
Why
does
this
come
up
as
the
first
result
when
search
RDJ
has
shoe
game
This
guy's
legend
This
is
just
great
Jimmy
And
then
surprise
BANG
There
it
is
Lamborghini
What
does
that
feel
like
You
know
RDJ
Is
that
kind
of
Oh
that
sausage
Awww
felt
so
bad
LOL
Total
lack
of
confidence
had
me
heartbroken
That
was
the
best
interview
ve
ever
watched
love
how
he
still
sometimes
acts
like
tony
stark
the
way
he
talks
and
how
he
sarcastic
sometimes
WOW
LOVE
THIS
MAN
Is
that
sausage
died
Well

enough
out
of
you
One
of
his
quotes
There's
no
MCU

so
good
at
this

nice
way
of
dissing
each
other
I'm
in
love
with
Robert

They
re
like

When
he
said
annoyingly
physiological
Robert
sounded
like
Nicholas
cage
Robert

an
amazing
actor
love
him

That
made
me
super
calm

about
you
RDJ
AT
HIS
BEST

emotional
interview

I'm
so

Yeah
that's
basically
what
he
does
when
he's
Tony
Stark
love
it
how
RDJ
didn't
even
break
character
He
smiled
now
and
then
but
he
still
played
his
part

game
Robert

Jimmy
RDJ
is
so
amazing
can
watch
him
all
day
Who
is
watching
this
on
2k19
got
genuinely
sad
when
he
did
the
lacking
confidence
one
Epic
was
that
Robert

is
lit
Jimmy
kinda
went
into
his
Donald
Trump
impression
during
the
overly
calm
bit
lol

that
was
my
reaction
too
ve
watched
this
6
times
and
it
never
fails
to
put
smile
on
my
face
Thought
Robert

gonna
get
emotional
because
he
was
talking
about
Jude
what
emotion
is
robert
doesnt
know
what
car
is
3
05
when
the
edibles
hit
Robert
smells
Bacon
Omg
this
is
gold
Gordon
Vervungct
even
RDJ
wabted
to
laugh
still
don't
know
why
you
have
me
on
the
show
if
think
about
it
Says
RDJ
with
his
head
hanging
down
what
great
actor
made
me
aw
Who's
Robert
Downey
Jr
And
why
does
he
look
so
much
like
Tony
Stark
emotional
interview
Robert
smells
bacon
Exactly
3
years
before
infinity
war
love
how
after
Jimmy
gets
owned
by
Robert
he
starts
getting
nervous
and
shaky
And
always
called
him
stark
can
someone
please
appreciate
his
sense
of
humour
love
you
3000
tony
stark
oppa
Masterstroke
right
at
the
end
Robert
Downey

is
inimitable
peerless
all
of
the
above

an
amazing
recovery
from
jimmy

of
women
saying

such
an
AWESOME
actor
Robert
really
gave
us

of
iconic
quotes
in
this

Jimmy
expression
when
he
read
the
Robert
smells

one
he
was
like

was

Why

one
of

most
favorite
video

RDJ

multiple
times
throughout
this
interview

almost
midnight

OMG
Love
him
sooo
much
So
calm
cant
even
hear
you
So
he
can
ask
these
questions
without
him
walking
out
but
when
other
interviews
talk
about
this
he
walks
out
so
relaxed
can
even
hear
you
Robert

as
picked
Robert's

You

an

The

reminded
me
of
Nickalos
Cage
Did
anyone
else
think
this
was
an
actual
sad
interview
when
clicking
on
it
This
one
was
the
best
i'v
seen
They
managed
to
make
it
all
flow
together
so
smoothly
DDDD
nothing
lifts
my
spirits
as

as
this

Robert

love
you
3000
You
can
tell
how
amazing
of
an
actor
Robert
is
because
he
did
NOT
crack
at
any
point
during
the
improv
wouldn't
be
able
to
hold
serious
face
Talent
right
there
Card
Like
what
someone
sends
you
on
your
birthday
There
will
only
be
one
tony
still
can
see
him
without
his
beard
forgot
he
isnt
actually
dead
got
sad
for
no
reason
Totally
unrelated
but
his
voice
is
so
attractive
Good
luck
figuring
out
who
I'm
talking
about
JIMMY

YOU
tony

He's
trying
so

By

about
how
he
overcame
his
failures
This

to
how

actor

came
online
saved
the
quote
I'm
so
relaxed
can't

you
in
my
mind
and
want
to
get
it
as
tattoo
because
love
Robert
and
love
this
sentence
don't
know
why
Maybe
because
it
fits
perfectly
on
his
character
PS
no
joke

God
thought
I'm

in
that
moment

Robert
don
know
why
just
finding
this
but
this
is
the

man
RDJ

the
best
why

The
only

do
black
face
and
become
household
name
love
RDJ
Oh

sausage
That
would
be
pretty
random
if
there
weren't
any
subtitles
or
any
explanations
RDJ
is
man
full
of
talent
willing
to
do
wonderful
things
for
fans
and
weird
things
on
talk
shows
Nothing
can
out
cool
this
guy
he's
so
smooth
and
genuine
agh
have
an
addiction
to
RDJ
He's
the
best
thats
it
RDJ
is
so
cool
He
is
the
best
actor
ever
who
doesn't
love
Robert
Downey
Jr
who
doesn't
love
Robert
Downey
Jr
That
is
why
just
love
ROBERT
DOWNEY
JUNIOR
LOVE
YOU
TONY

of

funny
RDJ
is
the
spitting
image
of
Tony

from
Iron

He

def
contact
Marvel

work
something
out
He'd
kill
it
The
sad
one
like
Mcu
new
hiro
vul
brin
roby
Now
going
to
found
an
entire
sausage
corporation
and
call
it

Life

It
wants
your
children

this
guy
for
its
history
and
to
be
so
funny
and
true
and
gentle
with
everyone
our
eternal
Iron

LOL

Audience

Audience

Will

RDJ
are
my
top
two
favorite
actors

people
in
Hollywood
They
literally
are
2
of
the
coolest
and
smoothest
guys
in
Hollywood
I'd
love
to
see

literal
perfection
This
is

TONY

my
recommended
now
Honestly

no
difference
between
Fallon
and
Kimmel
It's
just
confusing
swear
have
never
seen
this
before
but
whenever
Jimmy
said
Lamborghini
thought
sausage
immediately
Wtf

Black

ROFLLLLLLLLLL
Robert

but
RDJ
face
is
intimidating
without

being
serious
The
overly
calm
RDJ
was
like

Jimmy

looked
like

was
doing
his
Trump
impersonation
have
the
same
shirt

You

actual

hard
in
quite
some
time
Who

is
off
the
charts
So

did
with
Channel

This
is
hilarious
Oh

sausage
god

his

couldn't

This

like

with
his
Tony

Jimmy
has
no

so
sad
too
oink
like

unrecognizable
without

Oh

is
so
planned

was
gonna
break
down
into
tears
Im
so
relaxed
cant
even
hear
you
RDJ
the
Great
2015
Smelling
bacon
means
you'r
having
stroke
Rip
was
expecting
something
completely
different
but
I'm
not
disappointed
as
to
what
got
Why
does
Jimmy
Fallon
talk
so
much
Didn
know
TV
talk
show
needed
to
click
bait
this
is
good
example
of
why
jimmy
was
great
choice
for
this
show
He
is
charismatic
and
sweet
faced
and
can
hold
conversation
with
anyone
He
really
is
great
host
He
is
so
cool
and
handsome
love
you
3000
Wish
when
Jimmy
said

Robert
said
Oh

It
Enough
of
you
just
spilled
my
water
over
my
maths
stuff
love
Robert

made
me
cry
so
much
from
laughter
It's
been
almost
3

be
one
of
my

The
question
is
only
answered
in
its
asking
Too

is
still
hilarious
Oh

The
reactions
RDJ
got
from
the
audience
by
just
acting
the
emotions
and
saying
ONE
sentence
like
hope
you
all
realize
how
good
of
an
actor
he
is
2

RDJ
has
incredible
acting
expressions
Jimmy
couldn
even
finish
his
sentence
when
RDJ
was
smelling
bacon

Jimmy
thought
it
would
work
This
is
the
best
interview
love
this
man

thought
this
would
be
about
him
talking
about
his

looks
at
Jimmy
when
Jimmy
said
Lamborghini
is
priceless
Oh
that
sausage
It
should'v
said
overly
calm
stoned
How
about
Viewer
entertainment
expectations
sold
short
again
by
Fallon
Kudos
to
both
although
Robert
probably
has
an
edge
Look
in
those
eye's
and
watch
all
the
demons
dance
could
never
hold
that
shit
together
Spooky
Wow
Apart
from
the
eyes
RDJ
looks
very
much
like
younger
Al
Pacino
Sorry
if
this
has
been
mentioned
before
RDJ
Lol
he's
so
talented
Late
to
the
party
know
but
this
was
gold
lol
GOD
ALMOST
DIED
LAUGHING
WOKE
UP
MY
CAT
GOD
Is
it
me
or
Would
Robert
make
great
professor
Snape

love
this
video
so
much
Please
do
it
with
subtitles

that
was
actually
his
Donald
Trump
impression
not
what
was
expecting
but
definitely
what
needed
Robert's
got
me
locked
in
Difference
between
RDJ
and
Tony
stark
is
just
beard
He
looks
like
Mike
Stoklasa
when
he
was
young
Jennifer
Lawerence
would
be
really
good
at
this
RDJ
4
LIFE
lamborghini
sausage
lol
Overly
Calm
was
literally
them
being
stoned
So
relax
can't
even
heard
you
lol
that
was
so
good
Robert
Downey
Jr
is
the
Best
Love
overly
calm
high
as
hell
My
English
is
not
good
but
can't
stop
laugh
when
saw
this
cute
guy
seemed
like
an
impression
of
trump
at
3
22
lol
Definitely
my
favorite
new
game
for
jimmy
Fallon
Don't
stop
robert
is
such
an
amazeing
actor
That
tie
in
at
the
end
tho
Uhhh
is
anyone
else
having
video
issues
Specifically
they
can
hear
the
audio
but
have
no
visuals
oh
love
you
Iron
Man
Downy
sounds
just
like
Chris
Jericho
this
guy
looks
like
Tony
Stark
anyone
else
getting
the
similarity
luv
uh
tony
sometimes
forget
that
hugh
and
robert
are
different
persons
and
hate
myself
for
that
RDJ
is
legend
It's
amazing
how
it's
obvious
that
he
can
act
so
well
He
sounds
just
like
Nick
Cage
all
my
youtube
videos
run
fine
except
talk
shows
and
snl
the
audio
plays
but
the
visuals
are
just
black
Takes
like
5
10
refreshes
before
they
show
up
Tony
is
the
best
mean
Robert
preferred
the
presenter
in
how
met
your
mother
this
is
why
he's
one
of
the
better
actors
out
there
you
have
no
use
how
many
times
have
replayed
this
love
it
so
so
so
much
Robert
was
great
in
the
80's
and
drifted
off
in
the
90's
and
it's
like
finally
directors
woke
up
in
2007
and
he's
BACK
loved
him
in
Zodiac
with
fellow
Avenger
Mark
Ruffalo
This
was
the
best
emotional
interview
2

hahahhaha
awwwwwww
hahahhahahahhahahah
assume
this
is
how
Jimmy
Fallon
goes
about
his
daily
life
RDJ
is
such
great
actor
and
this
honestly
just
proves
it
whoever
says
otherwise
can
fight
me
He
so
talented
When
he's
annoyingly
philosophical
why
does
he
sound
like
Nicholas
Cage
don't
even
know
why
you
still
have
me
on
this
show

is
jimmy
Impersonating
trump
Lamborghini
Is
that
kind
of
Oh
that's
sausage
Loved
that
part
love
this
soooo
much
RDJ
playing
Stark
must
be
easy
for
him
coz
he's
just
acting
naturally
Robert
turned
that
car
thing
around
so
good
RDJ
man
There
will
never
be
another

Rob's
face
is
just
so
adorable
this
one
is
actually
hilarious
am
pleasantly
surpised
does
anybody
else
think
that
rdj
is
fantastic
actor
He's
SUCH
great
actor
Inside
the
clam
of
life
is
what
we
all
strive
to
attain
The
gooey
stuff
Gordon
Vervunckt
wonder
how
much
they
payed
him
to
be
on
here
Robert
Downey
Jr
seems
like
genuinely
nice
person
just
watched
an
interview
where
the
interviewer
started
asking
really
personal
questions
and
he
just
calmly
walked
out
It
was
awesome
have
respect
for
this
man
It's
not
right
to
ask
someone
about
the
personal
things
they'v
been
through
If
they
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
that
stuff
they
would
do
it
on
their
own
Awkward
THIS
IS
SOOOO
FUNNY
LOL
New
but
biggest
fan
of
RDJ
Love
You
RDJ
bits
like
that
glorify
acting
as
whole
love

it

such
eaze
Omg

anybody

his
control
Great

CUMBERBATCH
Don't
like
much
of
the
segments
from
this
show
but
this
was
one
of
the
best
This
is
why
love
RDJ
If
RDJ
was
on
SNL
with
Jimmy
Fallon
he
may
have
actually
been
funny
He
sounds
like
Niccola
cage
little
He
reminds
me
of
Lin
Manuel
Miranda
is
it
just
me
Title
got
me
anyone
after
endgame
americans
mistaking
fishing
for

for

whole
day
Jeez

He

Best

maybe
any
talk

That
tighty
whities
joke
made
me
love
Jimmy
Fallon
The
dude
is
funny
and
at
any
cost
This
is
the
best
thing
I'v
ever
seen
FINALLY
youtube
app
got

How
is
it

Something
should'v

love
how
Jimmy
started
to
sound
like
Trump

RDJ
is
GOAT
At
1
14
swear
though
he
said
clown
at
2
16
the
aawwwww
sound
is
just
like
the
sound
when
you
log
in
to
Skype
My
smol
bean
is
so
hilarious
it's
the
riot
clown
or
some
clown
fish
Gorgeous
man
Tony
He's
still
saf
no
same
number
for
10
years
buddy
keep
coming
back
to
this
His
eyes
sparkle
I'm
not
crazy
This
segment
need
to
be
longer
than
4
minutes
Just
like
johnny
depp
he
doesn't
age
but
when
he
does
he
doesnt
The
man
in
the
seat
is
the
real
Iron
Man
CANT
SIT
THROUGH
THIS
LAUGH
TRACK
This
is
why
Tony
Stark
makes
good
Robert
Downey
Jr
He
like
let
me
help
you
then
throws
football
at
him
harder
lol
why
isnt
rdj
my
dad
wanted
them
to
do
condescending
so
badly
They
have
to
do
one
with
Ryan
Reynolds
Am
the
only
one
who
thought
that
RDJ
sounded
like
Nick
Cage
for
the
first
situation
Who
on
earth
is
Gordon
Vivont
lol
4
03
how
he
suggested
that
the
car
is
when
he
said
black
thing
on
wheel's
was
hoping
during
the
Robert
smelling
bacon
part
would
be
him
suspecting
Jimmy
being
an
undercover
cop
Am
the
only
one
who
thinks
Jimmy
and
Robert
are
really
similar
in
personalities
Is
it
emotional
because
iron
man
dies
The
philosophical
one
RDJ
sounds
like
Kevin
Spacey
you
have
to
agree
RDJ
has
Talent
Little
does
this
audience
know
that
Iron
Man
is
dead
in
Avengers
4
Iron
Man
forever
dad
He
kinda
sounds
like
nicholas
cage
in
the
first
one
THIS
is
how
you
do
late
night
TV
Hey
Mr
Fallon
could
you
maybe
spare
some
advice
for
that
other
Jimmy
He
doesn't
seem
to
have
clue
Rdj
is
GOD
What
charisma
RDJ
is
joy
to
watch
Emotional
chameleon
is
absolutely
right
Cool
both
were
great
Wow
Hands
down
the
only
funny
actor
that
can
be
funny
with
straight
face
im
weak
Hope
jimmy
fallon
falls
off
bridge
This
was
ok
but
Vince
Vaughn's
was
way
funnier
He
is
good
at
hiding
Omg
they
cringe
level
on
this
video
is
awesome
Cringe
level
9000
Robert
Downy
Junior
is
so
subtle
and
yet
profound
The
supremely
confident
RDJ's
transition
to
lack
of
confidence
was
brilliant
Does
RDJ
play
Tony
Stark
or
Tony
Stark
play
RDJ
I'v
killed
all
but
three
of
my
brain
cells
thinking
it
tony
stark
and
robert
are
the
same
person
Why
is
tony
stark
in
the
tonight
show
he
shld
be
out
there
fighting
with
bad
guys
He
is
so
unprofessional
He
is
so
intelligent
Robert
Downey
jr
is
the
man
Such
good
actor
Desperate
Boom
Lamborghini
you
mean
that
sausage
This
would
be
great
with
Kevin
Spacey
Sure
RDJ
may
not
be
scientific
genius
in
regards
to
one
of
his
most
famous
roles
but
he
is
definitely
genius
when
it
comes
to
acting
and
comedy
My
college
professor
is
the
double
of
Robert
Downey
Jr
so
relaxed
that
can't
hear
you
think
it
was
Grodon
Vervunct
freaking
died
at
that
part
man
That's
enough
outta
you
That's
enough
out
of
you
when
they
did
the
overly
calm
they
were
on
weed
Anyone
know
what
shirt
he's
wearing
Watched
this
10
times
already
Robert

28
wtf
I'm
so
relaxed
can't
even
hear
you

srsly
awwwwwwwwww
There
has
yet
to
be
funnier
Emotional
Interview
that
was
an
amazing
I'v
watched
this
so
many
times
Mr
Downey
Jr
You'r
an
inspiration
OMG
so
funny
when
Robert
doesn't
know
what
car
is
good
laugh
for
me
Hahahah
he's
genious
Robert
reminds
me
of
Tom
Hanks
his
voice
COULD
JUST
SEE
HIM
AS
IRON
MAN
Amazing
ending
Jimmy
thinks
RDJ
is
playing
The
Hulk
would'v
been
funny
Do
an
emotional
interview
with
Nicole
Kidman
such
funny
vid
boys
really
good
no
one
bought
the
lack
of
confidence
by
RDJ
HE
closed
it
perfectly
Holy
crap
he's
over
50
keep
forgetting
Need
to
redo
this
with
Dwayne
Johnson
and
Jim
Carrey
It's
always
fun
to
watch
these
and
see
jimmy
trying
to
keep
with
all
of
these
great
actors
Too
funny
Love
it
Awwe
the
lack
of
confidence
one
pulled
at
the
heart
strings
gosh
why
he
is
sooooo
cute
The
annoyingly
philosophical
was
so
good
Lmfao
think
we'v
all
met
person
like
that
aww
tony

sounds
like
Nicholas

Grahams
energy
and
involvement
Jimmy

Who

dialogue
of

They

Brandon
Howarth
was
wondering
when
you
walk
in
the
shop
and
find
something
you
like
years
ago
went
discontinued
demanded
disclosed
on
deadline
deleted
stock
time
line
extinction
time
line
old
obsolete
and
outdated
that
money
can't
buy
back
or
happiness
due
to
progress
and
change
everything
moves
forward
in
time
things
that
are
invaluable
and
irreplaceable
and
rare
to
come
across
especially
PS3
60
GB
HDD
2007
as
well
was
wondering
if
famous
people
get
that
as
well
as
non
famous
does
the
policies
still
apply
if
can
reply
Robert
downey
jr
I'm
been
try
to
find
an
answer
and
that
question
for
long
time
so
glad
that
RDJ

his
demons
and
is
back
to
acting
He
is
amazing
RDJ

best
Teeney
Sterk's
Mino
Ran

the
talk
show
you
can't
outwit
Stark
first
comment
Tropic
Thunder

To
know
is
to
understand
that

answered
in
its
asking
Dude

come
up
with
this
in
10
years
and
he
just
came
up
with
it

who
thought
that

it
turned
out
to
be
bit
Robert

EMOTION

Happy

Robert
Downey
Jr
RDJ
was
flawless
in
this
INCREDIBLE
same
number
for
10
years
Literally
the
only
difference
between
RDJ
and
Tony
Stark
is
that
RDJ
dyes
his
facial
hair
black
when
he's
Tony
Stark
Iron
Man
will
aways
be
Robert
Downey
Jr
That
is
Tony
Star
acting
like
RDJ
